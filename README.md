Background


A small auto dealership group across Texas, Newstar Auto, is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation to streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and leverage advanced analytics. The dealer group is composed of 3 individual dealerships of different brands, and a corporate office to manage shared admin responsibilities. Digital Transformation can be simply understood as rebuilding an organization with digital technologies at its core. This transformation serves to help the business remain agile, competitive, and scalable by gathering and using data more effectively, implementing automation where necessary, along with enhancing process and communication – all enabled by technology.

While digital transformation tends to be a rather large undertaking, we’ll focus on a few specific aspects of digital transformation for the purposes of this scenario. The group requires your expertise to help consider the security aspects of their transformation. For the purposes of this scenario we’ll discuss 3 core functions of the organization which are primarily taking part in this transformation: Sales, Marketing, and Service.

Sales

Modern sales processes need a mix of in-person and online touchpoints. Since sales determines the revenue and profitability of any business, the dealer group is looking to make significant investments to improve their sales operations.

Currently, the organization’s customer records are sorted within on-premises servers using a directory system (folders with files such as documents and PDFs). This system is only accessible via the devices on the network, which are password protected at the user level. There is no further encryption or access protection to the servers when on company hardware.

Sales staff store all of their lead pipeline information on local spreadsheets stored on individual computers and shared over email. This data is also heavily isolated to individual sales staff and individual dealerships. With this level of data isolation or ‘silos’ in place, it’s not possible to have a clear understanding of a customer’s interaction history with the business, and how their needs might have changed over time. It’s also very challenging to ensure everyone is operating from the most up-to-date data, and there are obvious scalability and security concerns with this type of setup. Suppose a customer was in touch with multiple employees at the same time, understanding where the customer is in their purchase journey would be difficult, the data is fragmented across multiple sources.

Moreover, inadequate record keeping with this system leads to poor inputs for the marketing and service teams within the organization. This is bilateral, as any relevant information from marketing or service isn’t making its way to sales. The organization is interested in transforming its sales approach, toward one focused on data-driven insights, automation, and improved collaboration. Specifically, the organization is looking at shifting toward a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) CRM Solution, such as Salesforce. Newstar Auto hopes to automate and streamline lead management, contact management, and workflow automation.

Marketing

Marketing within the dealer group is rather slow, responsive, and lacks personalization. Marketing is a single department shared across all dealers in the group and therefore is somewhat siloed from the operations of individual dealers. Traditional marketing efforts such as print, billboard, and the occasional email are used – which if anything can still be effective if considered and implemented correctly as part of a more comprehensive marketing strategy. However, that comprehensive, marketing strategy leveraging modern methods is what’s missing.

Seeing diminishing returns from their, the marketing team is looking to implement smarter, more proactive and modern marketing techniques as a core part of their new strategy. This involves first pivoting the team to a model where there will be dedicated individuals for each dealership within the group. These individuals will continue to work as a part of a single marketing department, but will be able to better manage the needs of each dealer and will be able to coordinate with the broader team to optimize resource allocation.

The marketing team will also implement more digital-first tools such as Google Analytics to understand user behavior on websites. They will also be using common SaaS tools like Hubspot to automate their marketing efforts across social media and email marketing. Finally, they’ll develop more digital advertising capabilities across marketplace sites (e.g. AutoTrader), and on ad platforms like Google Ads, Facebook, Instagram, etc.

The end goal is to leverage advanced analytics, automation, and digital channels to enhance targeting customers, enhancing brand and offer visibility, and re-targeting customers with personalized messaging given their interactions. Specifically, Newstar Auto hopes the digital transformation will facilitate targeted marketing campaigns, digital content creation, and customer segmentation. Tailoring marketing campaigns based on customer profiles, preferences, and behaviors will help the organization cater to more personalized and effective communication.

This is a massive transformation of their current operations, with new tools being provisioned, processes being implemented, and data being collected. Finally, they’ll also be hiring a graphic designer on a contractual basis to help with ad creation. This contractor isn’t part of the dealer group, yet still requires access to the right tools and data to complete their job.

Service

Currently, the service department runs off very traditional operating methods. Given their historically low customer volume in the past, appointments were scheduled over the phone. Customer records are still stored in the same on-prem server and a shared spreadsheet is used to manage the scheduled appointments.

As part of an effort to dramatically improve their efficiency and scalability, the dealer group is looking to integrate service data within Salesforce. They will also transition to storing data in the cloud and implement a third-party scheduling system for service appointments, vehicle deliveries, etc. Moreover, they are also looking to implement new programs to help expand their customer base – one such example is a multi-faceted loyalty program. Each aspect of the loyalty program is listed below;

Referrals and Credits

Current customers can fill out an online form to refer to a contact who is looking to purchase a new vehicle. This form requires all the basic information of the customer and the individual being referred. This includes their name, phone number, email address, preference of vehicle or vehicle type, etc.
Current customers are provided with a $100 service credit if the referred individual buys a car. The individual buying will receive a variable discount dependent on the model and type of vehicle (e.g. new, used, etc.). All personal data and the credits being provided need to be recorded securely and accurately.


Tenured Customers

Milestones for tenured customers who continue to service their vehicles with the dealer group will be established. Each milestone has an associated reward.
This program should be universal across the dealer group, so that if customers change brands but continue to purchase from the group, they will maintain their rewards.


Owner’s Club

Members pay an annual fee to gain access to certain benefits. Some of these benefits include, an annual detailing service, 2x weekly car washes, invitations to auto events, and discounts on merchandise.. They’ll need a system to manage user accounts to track their use of program benefits (i.e. how many car washes they have left, if they have used their annual detailing service, etc.)


Co-branded Offers

The dealer group is interested in partnering with other businesses to promote their offerings at a discounted rate to their clients. This provides value and discounts to their clients, while adding in a revenue stream to advertise for other businesses. To run this program, there is much data required from the partner businesses and customers alike.
